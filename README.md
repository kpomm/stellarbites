# Welcome to my project, titled StellarBites

## Overview

The motivation behind this project is to use multiple APIs in a way that can solve a problem. One thing that came to mind is how I often don't know what to make at home when I don't want to leave the house and go to the grocery store. Spoonacular offers a great API for this solution, that I use to provide recipes based on what the user has in their kitchen cabinet. However, there is a seasonal element, as you can mark the season in the dropdown and get recommended recipes based on the current season. 

There is additional functionality with Farmer's Market New York API, where I can suggest to the user nearby Farmer's Markets where they might obtain fresh ingredients for their seasonal recipes. Currently, the location is set to NYC (where I am ha!) but my future plans with the project are to find a more widespread API that can cover more locations than just New York. However, for now it is a great tool for me and many others to use while in the city this fall, or next summer!

## Specs

I created this app with React.js and Vite. I used SASS styling and axios for my API calls. 

## What Went Well? 

I feel like I know Spoonacular very well at this point after building this app, and think it is an awesome tool! I enjoyed wiring all the components together and making a comprehensive platform that uses multiple APIs in a cool way. 

## What Went Poorly 

Oh my goodness I spent a long time trying to find a good seasonal ingredient API and could not find one! Even the Farmer's Market API is a limited database that has poor documentation. I'm hoping in the future I could scrape a larger (maybe agricultural) database to set up the seasonal element of my recipes more effectively. 

## Other APIs... 

Another API I want to use to improve this app is Random Image API, to provide images of the ingredients the user might be missing for the recipe they want to make! In a perfect world, they aren't missing anything, but in the case they are missing things, this API makes it easy to visualize and comprehend!

As I said before, I saw a lot of agricultural APIs that I hope to use in the future!

# Takeaways

This was a fun project and it honestly inspired me to take on another side project while on my off term :)
