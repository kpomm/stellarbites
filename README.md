# Welcome to my project, titled StellarBites

The motivation behind this project is to use multiple APIs in a way that can solve a problem. One thing that came to mind is how I often don't know what to make at home when I don't want to leave the house and go to the grocery store. Spoonacular offers a great API for this solution, that I use to provide recipes based on what the user has in their kitchen cabinet.

Another API I want to use to improve this app is Random Image API, to provide images of the ingredients the user might be missing for the recipe they want to make! In a perfect world, they aren't missing anything, but in the case they are missing things, this API makes it easy to visualize and comprehend!
